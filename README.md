## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **LangChain**: LLM application framework
- **Groq**: Fast LLM inference
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database toolkit
- **SQLite**: Embedded database
- **MySQL**: Relational database
- **Faker**: Generate realistic test data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
You can set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Database Files
- Ensure `student.db` and `customer_transactions.db` are in the project root
- For MySQL connections, ensure the database server is accessible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   - Ensure you've entered a valid Groq API key
   - Check if the API key has proper permissions

2. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify database files exist in the correct location
   - For MySQL: check connection details and network access

3. **Query Errors**
   - The AI might need clarification for complex queries
   - Try rephrasing your question
   - Check if the requested data exists in the database

### Error Messages
- `The api_key client option must be set`: Enter your Groq API key
- `Please provide all MySQL connection details`: Fill in all MySQL fields
- Database connection errors: Check file paths and permissions
